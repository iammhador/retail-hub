# Modern Retailer Table Component

This project provides a dynamic table component designed to display retailer information with sorting, row expansion, and animation. It includes a loading and empty state with animations to provide a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Expandable Rows**: Click on a retailer's name to expand and view additional details such as `Pros`, `Cons`, and `Note`.
- **Loading and Empty State**: Custom animations display while data is loading or when no retailers are found.
- **Action Buttons**: Each retailer row includes `Edit` and `Delete` buttons for managing the retailer.

## Technologies Used
